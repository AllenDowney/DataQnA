    "# What does a confidence interval mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [question from the Reddit statistics forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1c3iqdd/q_why_does_a_confidence_interval_not_tell_you/) (with an edit for clarity):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why does a confidence interval not tell you that 90% of the time, [the true value of the population parameter] will be in the interval, or something along those lines?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I understand that the interpretation of confidence intervals is that with repeated samples from the population, 90% of the time the interval would contain the true value of whatever it is you're estimating. What I don't understand is why this method doesn't really tell you anything about what that parameter value is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, to put it mildly, a common source of confusion.\n",
    "And here is one of the responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "> From a frequentist perspective, the true value of the parameter is fixed. Thus, once you have calculated your confidence interval, one if two things are true: either the true parameter value is inside the interval, or it is outside it. So the probability that the interval contains the true value is either 0 or 1, but you can never know which.\n",
    "\n",
    "This response is the conventional answer to this question -- it is what you find in most textbooks and what is taught in most classes.\n",
    "And, in my opinion, it is wrong.\n",
    "To explain why, I'll start with a story."
