# Data Q&A

*Data Q&A* is a series of articles where I answer questions from Reddit's statistics forum, using Python code in a Jupyter notebook.

At the beginning of each article, there's a link you can use to run the notebooks on Colab.

This material is a work in progress, so suggestions are welcome.  The best way to provide feedback is to [click here and create an issue in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/DataQnA/issues).
